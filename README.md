# Image-Colorization
Convert a greyscale image to a Colored image

# Description and Explaination:
In this model we have used the latest neural network which mainly involves using the Resnet for fundamental feature extraction and thereby combining it or rather merging it with a layer which introduces iself after the pooling layer of the input. We then decode it with the convolutional layers through upsampling in order to predict the new coloured image. We can also use various types of GAN such as Cycle gan and pix2pix GAN which are currently used for advanced image colourization.

In this model we have used an Auto-encoder which also becomes the generator in the case of the GAN network.
